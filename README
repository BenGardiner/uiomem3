#### uiomem3

A command-line utility based on devmem2 by Jan-Derk Bakker [1].

Whereas devmem2 facilitates individual reads and writes to the physical
addresses, uiomem3 facilitates the same to the maps exposed by UIO 
drivers [2].

#### Usage

    Usage: ./uiomem3 UIO-DEVICE MAP-NUMBER OFFSET [ TYPE [ DATA ] ]
    Read-from or write-to the MAP-NUMBER of UIO-DEVICE at OFFSET.
    
            UIO-DEVICE      the UIO device to open e.g. /dev/uio0
            MAP-NUMBER      the number of the UIO map in which to operate
            OFFSET          memory offset in the map upon which to act
            TYPE            access operation type : [b]yte, [h]alfword, [w]ord (default) 
            DATA            data to be written
    
    When DATA is not given OFFSET is read, otherwise DATA is written to OFFSET
